Task: Prime Number Generator and Checker
Create a C++ program that:
1. User Option: Ask the user whether they want to find prime numbers in a given range
or check if a specific number is prime.
2. Finding Prime Numbers:
• Users input a range, and the program displays all prime numbers within that
range.
• Use loops to iterate through the range and decision statements to identify
prime numbers.
3. Checking Prime Numbers:
• Users input a number, and the program displays whether it's prime or not.
• Implement a reliable algorithm to check for prime numbers.
